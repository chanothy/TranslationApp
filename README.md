## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
* The biggest challenge was ensuring the viewModel text view was updating as the translating was happening.
* Reason being, the ml kit works asynchronously, so the view model needed to update ~after~ the translating has completed.  We utilized MutableLiveData<String> updating to combat this problem

Logic
* The user chooses their source and target language.
* There is an textToTranslate observer:
* IF: the "DetectLanguage" radio button was selected, the detectLanguage() method is called.  This will set the detectedLanguage viewModel variable to the detected language.
* Then, it will translate the user's text input
* ELSE: the user's text input will be immediately translated with the selected source and target languages.
